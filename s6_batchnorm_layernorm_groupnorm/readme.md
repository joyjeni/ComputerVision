This repository tells you how to differnt types of normalization and analysis of each


### 1. Add normalization

i.  Network with Group Normalization 

ii.  Network with Layer Normalization 

iii.  Network with L1 + BN 


### 2. Write a single model.py file that includes 

  i.   GN/LN/BN and takes an argument to decide which normalization to include 
  
  ii.  Write a single notebook file to run all the 3 models above for 20 epochs each 
  
  
### 3. Create these graphs:

      i. Graph 1: Test/Validation Loss for all 3 models together
      
      ii. Graph 2: Test/Validation Accuracy for 3 models together 
      
      graphs must have proper annotation
      
### 4. Find 10 misclassified images for each of the 3 models, and show them as a 5x2 image matrix in 3 separately annotated images. 
### 5. Analysis
     i.  Code walkthrough
     
     ii.  how to perform the 3  normalization BN,LN,GN
     
     iii.  findings for normalization techniques
     
     iv.  add all your graphs train & val accuracy graph, train and test loss graph
     
     v.  3 collection-of-misclassified-images
